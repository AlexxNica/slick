# chat
A repo about how to "chat" with open source devs and designers- closing the gap :D

For now you can use the [web interface for the #opensourcedesign chat room](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opensourcedesign). We are working on a better way of having the log available (it's currently available [here](https://botbot.me/freenode/opensourcedesign/)), and setting up a [nicer app](http://shout-irc.com/) to use it.

(If you know how to use IRC, connect to #opensourcedesign on freenode.net ;)
